## üåü About SoloPDF

SoloPDF is an ambitious **open-source** project aimed at creating a powerful, intuitive, and comprehensive command-line and programmatic tool for PDF manipulation. In a world with many PDF libraries, SoloPDF stands out by prioritizing **developer experience** and modern standards. Inspired by the robustness of tools like `pdfcpu`, SoloPDF is designed from the ground up with modern development practices, written entirely in **TypeScript**, and built for the **Node.js ecosystem**.

Our goal is to build a tool that is not only feature-rich but also incredibly easy to integrate into your projects or use directly from the terminal. We are building this project in the open, sharing our progress, and we welcome contributors of all levels to join us on this journey to build the best PDF tool available.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Roadmap)

Our vision is for SoloPDF to be a one-stop shop for PDF tasks. The planned features include:

  * **Create PDFs:** Generate PDFs from scratch using a simple, declarative API. Define your document structure with code for maximum flexibility and version control.
  * **Modify PDFs:** Perform complex manipulations with simple commands. Merge multiple documents, split a file into individual pages, rotate pages, reorder them, or extract a specific page range.
  * **Generate from HTML:** Convert any HTML file or live URL directly into a pixel-perfect PDF, preserving styles, images, and layout.
  * **Customize Content:** Add text with specific fonts and formatting, overlay images as watermarks or figures, and draw basic shapes to annotate or structure your documents with precision.
  * **Form Filling:** Programmatically find and fill out interactive PDF forms, saving time and automating workflows.
  * **Digital Signatures:** Add cryptographically secure digital signatures to documents, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
  * **Text Extraction:** Easily extract and parse text content from PDF files for data processing, indexing, or analysis.
  * **Optimization:** Reduce file size for easier sharing and faster web loading by optimizing images, removing redundant data, and compressing content without sacrificing quality.

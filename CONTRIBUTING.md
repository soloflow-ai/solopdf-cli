### Pull Request Process

1.  **Make your changes:** Add new features or fix bugs in your branch.
2.  **Add tests\!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. We use **Jest** for testing. Run all tests to ensure they pass:

    npm run format
    ```
4.  **Update the documentation.** If you added a new feature or changed an existing one, update the `README.md` or other relevant documentation files.
5.  **Issue that pull request\!** Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request. Make sure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable (e.g., `Closes #123`).
